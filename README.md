# let

This project appears to be a simple web application or static website. Below is an overview of the project structure and its contents:

## Project Structure

```
let/
  ├── index.html              # Main entry HTML file
  └── let/
      ├── dog.png             # Image asset (dog)
      ├── house.png           # Image asset (house)
      ├── index.html          # Secondary HTML file (possibly for a subpage)
      ├── script.js           # JavaScript file for interactivity
      └── style.css           # CSS file for styling
```

## How to Use

1. Open `let/index.html` in your web browser to view the main page.
2. The `let/let/index.html` file may serve as a subpage or additional content.
3. The images (`dog.png`, `house.png`) are used within the HTML files.
4. Styling is handled by `style.css` and interactivity by `script.js`.

## Customization
- You can modify the HTML, CSS, and JS files in the `let/let/` directory to change the content, appearance, or behavior of the site.
- Add more images or assets as needed.
